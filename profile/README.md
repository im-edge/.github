Welcome to IMEdge - Monitoring on the Edge
==========================================

The IMEdge namespace ships a bunch of powerful components for your Open Source Monitoring environment.
As in Edge Computing best practices, this brings processing closer to the data source. The project is
currently in the making, please expect further details soon.

While this has been designed and built as an extension to the [Icinga](https://icinga.com) ecosystem,
it currently is not an official Icinga project. After some back and forth, with naming issues hindering
development, we opted for a white label approach. Still, IMEdge is an unofficial shortcut for **Icinga
Monitoring Edge**. Many thanks go to our main development sponsor [WÃ¼rth Phoenix](https://www.wuerth-phoenix.com/de/produkt/unified-monitoring/),
for allowing us to finally realize something we dreamed of for a long time.

> [!CAUTION]
> We're currently working hard to get a first public alpha release ready. Installation instructions
> will follow as soon as we got our main core components ready, please stay tuned. Developers: Some of
> these libraries are highly opinionated, others are very generic. We'll ship related documentation for
> the generic ones, as they might be useful in other projects too.

Icinga Web Module
-----------------

This module provides the IMEdge module for Icinga Web 2. Currently, this module
allows to control local and remote IMEdge nodes, is proxying graph requests,
and provides access to our inventory database.
