Welcome to IMEdge - Monitoring on the Edge
==========================================

The IMEdge namespace ships a bunch of powerful components for your Open Source Monitoring environment.
This is currently in the making, please expect further details soon. While this has been designed and
built as an extension to the [Icinga](https://icinga.com) ecosystem, it currently is not an official
Icinga project. After some back and forth, with naming issues hindering development, we opted for a
white label approach.

Still, IMEdge is an unofficial shortcut for **Icinga Monitoring Edge**. As in Edge Computing best
practices, this brings processing closer to the data source. Many thanks go to our main development
sponsor, [WÃ¼rth Phoenix](https://www.wuerth-phoenix.com/de/produkt/unified-monitoring/).

> [!CAUTION]
> We're currently working hard to get a first public alpha release ready. Installations instructions
> will follow as soon as we got the main core components ready. Please stay tuned. Some of our
> libraries are very opinionated, others are very generic. We'll ship related documentation for
> the generic ones, as they might be used in other projects too.
